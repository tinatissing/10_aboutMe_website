    <!-- h2 tag has the second largest text and is usually reserved for section titles -->
    <p> Speed stacking also known as sport stacking or cup stacking is a sport where you stack plastic cups up and down as fast as you can in a certain succession. The three official patterns are in three pyramids of three, 3-3-3, two pyramids of three and one pyramid of six, 3-6-3, and a cycle stack that includes all different kinds of pyramids. You can stack as an individual, a pair (doubles), or a team of four (relay). This is an official sport in the Junior Olympics, and Canada hosted the World Championships for the first time in Montreal, 2015. </p>

    <h2>Different Ways to Stack</h2>
    <p> There are many different patterns in which you can stack cups. In competitions they will only time you in three individual events, the 3-3-3, the 3-6-3, and the Cycle, which is the most popular if the three. Once you hit the official competition table, you get two practices and three real recorded tries at each pattern of stacking. </p>
    <h3>3-3-3</h3>
    <!-- h3 tag has the third largest text and is usually reserved for sub section titles -->
    <p> The 3-3-3 stack is the simplest of the three. You stack three small pyramids of three cups in order, then stack them down in the same order you up stacked them. The world record for this is 1.363 seconds, held by William Orrell (team USA). </p> 
    <p> The 3-3-3 stack looks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F0oKV6QPrQ"> this </a></p>
    <!-- a represents you anchoring you rwebpage to another -->
    <!-- h ref represents hyperlink reference -->
    <!-- All words sitting in between the reference and close tag represent the link -->
    
    <h3>3-6-3</h3>
	<p> The 3-6-3 is a little more complicated than the 3-3-3 stack. You stack one pyramid of three, one pyramid of six cups, and another pyramid of three. Like the 3-3-3, you have to stack them all down after in the same order you stacked them up. The world record for this stack is 1.793, also held by William Orrell. </p>

	<h3>Cycle</h3>
    <p>The cycle is the most popular pattern. It's much more complicated then either of the other stacks. The world record holder of this stack is once again, William Orrell. </p>

    <h2>Tina's Speed Stacking Experience</h2> <img src="images/wssa_logo.png" width="250" alt="World Speed Stacking Association Logo">
    <p>I started competetively speed stacking when I was in grade 6. I was invited to compete in the 2013 Junior Olympics in Detroit, and was given the oppertunity to represent my country. I've been cup stacking every year since then and have been given many amazing oppertunities and have been able to experience many amazing things because of this sport. I've been able to compete in the World Championships in Montreal (the first time Canada had hosted the Worlds), and came in 8th. This year I've been given the oppertunity to speed stack on stage at the World Cup of Hockey I have also been given the oppertunity to team up with the World Speed Stacking Association to organize and preform a childrens birthday parties. I get paid to do this and I am given hours for volunteering as a ref at elementary school tournaments. </p>
